// let the person free write what happened
// then ask what are you feeling
// objectively, what actions did the other person do?

// when they click a feelings button register that it has been clicked
// by highlighting it / depressing it
// if they click again it unclicks
// there is a submit button so you know how many & which ones

//next steps:
// reaffirm what they have said, display feelings
// what needs have not been met?
// display needs under categories

//even later:
// save all the things in the database
// display all of it in a sentence:
// when this happens, i felt ____, my needs for ___, _____, and ___ 
// were not being met

// do a sentiment analysis on the first free write

// machine learning so that you create a training set from what they 
// said and what emotions they reported to see if you can predict
// the emotions given another set
